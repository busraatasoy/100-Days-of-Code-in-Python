# Loops: While :
# What is a Loop?
'''
- **Loops** are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
    
# **while Loop:**  
- Runs as long as a specified condition is **True.** '''
    
# Create while Loop:
while something_is_true:
    #Do something repeatedly

#Example:
x = 0
while x < 5:  # Runs until x is 5
    print(x)
    x += 1
  
#Special Keywords in Loops:
'''
- `break`: Stops the loop immediately.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
- `pass`: Does nothing, used as a placeholder.

In short, **loops help automate repetitive tasks**, making your code more efficient. '''
