#Infinite Loop:
'''    
- An infinite loop occurs when the condition of a loop (such as `while` or `for`) is always true, causing the loop to repeat forever without stopping.
- It happens when thereâ€™s no way for the loop's condition to eventually become false. '''
    
#Example:
while 5 > 3:
print("This loop will run forever!")

#This loop will keep printing "This loop will run forever!" because the condition 5 > 3 is always true.
