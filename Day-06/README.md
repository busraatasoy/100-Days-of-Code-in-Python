# 📅 **Day-06: Python Functions & Karel**  

We dived deep into **Python Functions** and explored their structure, purpose, and usage. We also practiced with **Karel the Robot**, solving various challenges to understand functions, loops, and indentation better. This day was packed with hands-on coding to grasp the concepts efficiently.
