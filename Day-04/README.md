# Day 04: Randomisation and Python Lists  

In **Day 04**, we explored the concepts of *Randomisation* and *Python Lists*. This day covered how to use Python's built-in `random` module for generating random numbers and selecting random elements from a list. We also created multiple projects to apply these concepts in real scenarios.
