# 📅 **Day-07: Hangman Game**  

We built the classic **Hangman Game** step by step, learning important concepts like list manipulation, conditional logic, and function structuring. We also designed the game to handle user input effectively and provide a better user experience with ASCII art and modular code.

## 📌 **Topics Covered - What I Learned?**  

**Flow Chart for Hangman:**  
- Visual representation of game logic before coding.  

**Step 1 - Picking a Random Word and Checking Answers:**  
- Randomly selecting a word from a list.  
- Verifying user guesses against the chosen word.  

**Step 2 - Replacing Blanks with Guesses:**  
- Displaying blanks (`_`) for each letter in the word.  
- Replacing blanks with correct guesses.  

**Step 3 - Checking if the Player has Won:**  
- Logic to determine if all blanks are filled with correct guesses.  
- Announcing the win condition.  

**Step 4 - Keeping Track of the Player’s Lives:**  
- Managing lives and decrementing on incorrect guesses.  
- Displaying remaining lives to the player.  

**Step 5 - Improving the User Experience:**  
- Created **Hangman_art.py** for ASCII art display.  
- Created **Hangman_words.py** for word list management.  
- Modular structure for better readability and reusability.
