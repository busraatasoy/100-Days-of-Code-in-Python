# 📅 **Day-05: Python Loops**

In Day 05, we explored the concepts of loops in Python, with a focus on `for` loops and the `range()` function. We also tackled various challenges like finding the highest score, summing numbers efficiently using loops, and building interactive mini-games.

## 📌 **Topics Covered - What I Learned?**  

**Loops: For**  
- How to iterate over a sequence like lists, strings, or ranges.  

**Highest Score Calculation:**  
- A program to find the highest score from a list of student scores.  

**Loops with Range:**  
- Using the `range()` function to control start, stop, and step values in loops.  

**The Gauss Challenge:**  
- Efficiently summing numbers from 1 to 100 using loops.  

**The FizzBuzz Game Challenge:**  
- Implementing the classic FizzBuzz game with condition-based logic inside loops.  

**Password Generator Project:**  
- Creating a secure password generator that uses random letters, numbers, and symbols.
