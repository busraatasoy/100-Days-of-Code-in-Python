#What is a Loop?
#Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

# for Loop:
#Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, string, or range).'''

# Creating a for Loop:
for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item

#Example of Fruits:
#List of fruits
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach" , "Pear"]

#Each item in the list is printed with for
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + "pie" )

# Special Keywords in Loops:

# break: Stops the loop immediately.
# continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
# pass: Does nothing, used as a placeholder.

#In short, **loops help automate repetitive tasks**, making your code more efficient.
